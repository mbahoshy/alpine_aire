				<p><b>Building a new home? Look no further than Alpine Aire</b></p>
				
				<p>Each heating and cooling system installed by Alpine Aire is custom designed to meet the needs of your home, and make your family comfortable. A professional "Heat Loss/Gain" calculation is performed to properly size the air handler and heat pump required for your home. This wil ensure that your home remains comfortable year round.</p>
				<p><b>The single biggest and most expensive problem with many HVAC systems today is improper duct work.</b></p>
	
				<p>Duct work that is improperly sized, or poorly installed, will not allow air to properly flow throughout your home. This creates problems like <i>stagnant air</i>, and <i>temperature imbalance</i>.</p>
				<img src='../images/construction.jpg' alt='new hvac installation' class='fright padleft padbot'	/>	
				<p><b>Performance is our passion</b>- we work hard to design and build systems that promote <i>even air flow</i>, <i>low velocity sound</i>, and <i>even temperatures</i> ... in a word, <i>comfort</i>. Our duct work is custom built at our sheet metal shop right here in  Wenatchee. You will NEVER find Alpine Aire throwing a "flex party".</p>
				<p><b>Radiant, Heat Recovery Systems, and Duct-free splits? We do that too.</b></p>
				<p>Alpine Aire also prides itself in specialized heating and cooling systems. If radiant in-floor heating, or another ductless systems sparks your interest, our team of service technicians are qualified to install a range of heating and cooling alternatives.</p>
				<p>If you want heat or cool different parts of the house independently from each other, make sure to ask about our <b>zoning options.</b></p>
