				<img alt='dirty air filters' src='../images/dirty_air_filters.jpg' class='fright padleft'	/>
				<p>Generally most filters should be changed every 1-2 months. Your filter may need to be changed more often than this depending on the quality of air in your home</p>
				<p>It is a good idea to regularly inspect your filter for signs of dirt and/or damage. If it looks dirty, then it is no longer doing its job and needs to be replaced.</p>
				<p>Other filters, like the 4" pleated filter, need to be changed less often, approximately every 4-5 months.</p>
				<p><b>Electronic air filters</b> never need to be replaced! However, <i>these filters should be cleaned regularly</i>. <a href='residential-planned-maintenance.php'>Planned Maintenance</a> customers will automatically receive this service during their scheduled appointment.</p>
