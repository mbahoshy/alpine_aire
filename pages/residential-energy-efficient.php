				<p><b>What are my Energy Efficient options?</b></p>
				<p>The latest buzzword in the HVAC industry is "Energy Efficient" - but what does that mean?</p>
				<p>Energy efficient means that your HVAC system maintains maximum performance while consuming minimal energy.</p>
				<p>This translates into very real savings on your energy bill. In most cases, energy efficient systems will pay for themselves in just a few short years.</p>
				<p>Energy efficient also means <i>better performance</i>. Because energy is conserved so well, your HVAC system is not only saving you money, it is <b>performing better</b>.</p>
				<p>Carrier products lead the way in energy efficiency. <a target='_blank' href='http://www.carrier.com/homecomfort/en/us/hvac-101/'>Click here</a> to learn more about energy efficiency, like what a "SEER" rating is. Or feel free to call Alpine Aire to speak with a representative.</p>
