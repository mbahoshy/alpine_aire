				<p>People often ask us, "How can I avoid expensive furnace and AC repairs?</p>
				<p>The answer is simple <b>Planned Maintenance</b>.</p>
				<p>Just like your car requires tune-ups and oil changes, your furnace and airconditioning unit require regular maintenance to prevent components from from failing.</p>
				<p>When you sign up for Alpine Aire Planned Maintenance, you will be scheduled twice yearly for a HVAC system checkup.</p>
				<p>When a service technician arrives for your scheduled appointment, your HVAC system will be thoroughly cleaned and inspected. Cleaning your furnace coil and components prevents dangerous build-up that may cause components to fail.</p>
				<p>A thorough diagnosis of system components makes it easy to find and fix small problems <i>before</i> they turn into large (and expensive!) ones.</p>
